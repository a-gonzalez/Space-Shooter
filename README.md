# Space-Shooter a JS tutorial
Another great lesson from https://www.youtube.com/@Frankslaboratory (State Management - 2)

Every mobile game needs to have 3 main elements: fullscreen, touch controls & optimized code, that runs well on a variety of devices. We will do all of that, and we will 1) build a BLANK REUSABLE BOILERPLATE project and 2) in the advanced section we will add graphics, animation & sounds to turn it into an ANIMATED SPACE HORROR game. Scary noises included. 

OBJECT POOL DESIGN PATTERN allows us to reuse objects, rather than constantly creating new ones and destroying the old ones. This approach will improve the performance of the codebase, because it solves problems with automatic memory allocation and garbage collection processes. 

STATE DESIGN PATTERN allows us to separate behaviors of the object into separate code blocks, giving us the ultimate control over each individual state, while at the same time making the code easier to read, maintain and debug. 

Let's learn how to implement both of these design patterns in a real project using JavaScript & HTML Canvas.
